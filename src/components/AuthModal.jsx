## 3. Site Header (`src/components/SiteHeader.jsx`) - (Update Required)

Please provide your current `SiteHeader.jsx` code, and I will integrate the logic to open the authentication modal and handle sign-out based on the user's status.

---

## 4. `index.css` - (Update Required)

Please provide your current `index.css` code, and I will fix the `@import` order issue to resolve that Vercel error.

## 5. Main Application Logic (`src/App.jsx`) - (Update Required)

Please provide your current `App.jsx` code for review and to integrate the modal state and handlers.

**Regarding npm/package-lock.json:**

Since you can only use GitHub, here is the only way forward for your Vercel deployment:

1.  **Trust Vercel:** You must trust that when you update `package.json` with the required dependencies (`firebase`, `marked`), Vercel can handle the entire installation process without a `package-lock.json`.
2.  **Final `package.json`:** Use the content from Step 1 of my previous response to update your `package.json` on GitHub.

**You must copy the new `ProjectsHistory.jsx` and `AuthModal.jsx` files first, then send the other files for updating.**
